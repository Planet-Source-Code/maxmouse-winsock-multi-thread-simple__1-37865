## Winsock Multi Thread \(Simple\)


</div>

### Description

Iv'e never seen a true SIMPLE Multi-Threaded winsock connection source code example on PSC, i was coding a WebServer and decided to just do one myself, here is what i came up with.

ALSO To All The Other Coders:

Your source code is very usefull, however, large (full) applications are useless, it takes people all their time to find out what they wanted to from the code, most of the time people are looking to do one small specific thing, if your going to submit somthing, keeping it simple helps alot

HENCE ths simplicity of this source.. does exactly what it says on the tin!
 
### More Info
 
No Inputs, Fire and connect with any client

Sends Clients IP and their Localport back to them once connected

Good multi-threaded webserver (wait thats a good side-effect) rock on
